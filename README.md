# SeedPool

> On-chain micro-lending for smallholder farmers to buy seeds and fertilizer — no bank required.

---

## Problem
A cassava farmer in Isabela, Philippines needs ₱3,000 for seeds at the start of planting season but has no credit history and the nearest rural bank is 40km away — so they borrow from a 5-6 lender (loan sharks) at 20% monthly interest, losing 30–40% of harvest income to repayment.

## Solution
SeedPool allows an NGO or farmer cooperative to issue USDC micro-loans directly to farmer wallets via a Soroban smart contract. Repayments are tracked transparently on-chain. No credit score needed — just a Stellar wallet. Loan history on-chain builds a decentralized credit record over time.

---

## Stellar Features Used
- USDC transfers — disbursement and repayment in stablecoin
- Soroban smart contracts — loan issuance, repayment tracking, duplicate-loan prevention
- Trustlines — farmer must hold USDC trustline before receiving funds
- Stellar's sub-cent fees — viable for loans as small as $5 USD

---

## Vision & Purpose
Rural lending in SEA is dominated by informal lenders charging 240%+ APR. SeedPool gives cooperatives and NGOs a zero-infrastructure lending tool that creates verifiable on-chain credit history for farmers — enabling them to eventually access DeFi credit markets.

|-------|----------|
